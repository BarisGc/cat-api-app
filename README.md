### Project Main Goal: 
- Building "Cat-Api-App" to practice how to handle api requests especially using Postman, how to use api responses in Front-End and also to practice react-redux (state management), react-router(for routing).
### Project Sub-Goals:
- createAsyncThunk
- To experience "react-masonry-css" library
- To practice "Axios" library, "promise" and "Try-Catch" structures
- Using useHistory hook for redirection so getting some errors like "undefined value of a paramter" while navigating or due to state changes can be prevented
### Completed: 
- Yes
### Notes:
 Normalization is the process of reorganizing data so that it meets two basic requirements:
- There is no redundancy of data, all data is stored in only one place.
- Data dependencies are logical,all related data items are stored together.
- Performance increases; 
- For example: 
  - No need "array.find" method which checks every element in array to find a searched element.
  - Managing crud operations easier
